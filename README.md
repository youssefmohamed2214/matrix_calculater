# matrix_calculater
This program offers two modes for matrix operations: (1) Single Matrix Mode: transpose, determinant (2x2/3x3), inverse (Gauss-Jordan), and rank (2x2/3x3). (2) Dual Matrix Mode: addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two matrices. Users can efficiently explore and perform these operations.
